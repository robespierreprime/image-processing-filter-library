# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a comprehensive set of image enhancement and manipulation filters to the existing image processing library. The filters will include basic color adjustments (invert, hue rotation, saturation), advanced processing techniques (dither, gamma correction, contrast), blur effects (gaussian and motion), and special effects (RGB shift, noise). Additionally, existing artistic filters (glitch and print simulation) will be enhanced to utilize the new RGB shift and noise filters respectively.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the image processing library, I want to apply basic color manipulation filters (invert, hue rotation, saturation) to images, so that I can perform fundamental color adjustments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I apply an invert color filter THEN the system SHALL invert all RGB values (255 - original_value)
2. WHEN I apply a hue rotation filter with a rotation angle THEN the system SHALL rotate the hue values in HSV color space by the specified degrees
3. WHEN I apply a saturation filter with a saturation factor THEN the system SHALL adjust the saturation component in HSV color space by the specified multiplier
4. WHEN I provide invalid parameters (negative saturation, hue rotation outside 0-360) THEN the system SHALL raise appropriate validation errors
5. WHEN I apply these filters to RGB images THEN the system SHALL maintain the original image dimensions and data type

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to apply dithering effects with multiple pattern types to images, so that I can create stylized reduced-color representations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I apply a dither filter with Floyd-Steinberg pattern THEN the system SHALL apply error diffusion dithering using the Floyd-Steinberg algorithm
2. WHEN I apply a dither filter with Bayer pattern THEN the system SHALL apply ordered dithering using Bayer matrices
3. WHEN I apply a dither filter with random pattern THEN the system SHALL apply random threshold dithering
4. WHEN I specify the number of color levels THEN the system SHALL quantize colors to the specified number of levels before dithering
5. WHEN I provide invalid dither parameters (levels < 2, invalid pattern type) THEN the system SHALL raise validation errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to apply gamma correction and contrast adjustment filters to images, so that I can control brightness and contrast characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I apply gamma correction with a gamma value THEN the system SHALL apply the power law transformation (output = input^(1/gamma))
2. WHEN I apply contrast adjustment with a contrast factor THEN the system SHALL scale pixel values around the midpoint (128 for uint8)
3. WHEN gamma value is 1.0 THEN the system SHALL return the original image unchanged
4. WHEN contrast factor is 1.0 THEN the system SHALL return the original image unchanged
5. WHEN I provide invalid parameters (gamma <= 0, negative contrast) THEN the system SHALL raise validation errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to apply blur effects (gaussian and motion blur) to images, so that I can create smooth or directional blur effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I apply gaussian blur with a sigma value THEN the system SHALL convolve the image with a gaussian kernel
2. WHEN I apply motion blur with angle and distance parameters THEN the system SHALL create directional blur in the specified direction
3. WHEN sigma is 0 for gaussian blur THEN the system SHALL return the original image unchanged
4. WHEN distance is 0 for motion blur THEN the system SHALL return the original image unchanged
5. WHEN I provide invalid blur parameters (negative sigma, invalid angle) THEN the system SHALL raise validation errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to apply RGB shift effects to images, so that I can create chromatic aberration and glitch effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I apply RGB shift with channel offsets THEN the system SHALL shift each color channel by the specified pixel amounts
2. WHEN I specify different shift amounts for R, G, B channels THEN the system SHALL apply independent shifts to each channel
3. WHEN shift amounts are 0 THEN the system SHALL return the original image unchanged
4. WHEN shift amounts would move pixels outside image boundaries THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases appropriately (clipping or wrapping)
5. WHEN the existing glitch filter is updated THEN it SHALL use the new RGB shift filter internally for color channel manipulation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to apply noise effects to images, so that I can simulate various types of image degradation and artistic effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I apply gaussian noise with specified intensity THEN the system SHALL add normally distributed random values to pixel intensities
2. WHEN I apply salt-and-pepper noise with specified probability THEN the system SHALL randomly set pixels to minimum or maximum values
3. WHEN I apply uniform noise with specified range THEN the system SHALL add uniformly distributed random values within the specified range
4. WHEN noise intensity is 0 THEN the system SHALL return the original image unchanged
5. WHEN the existing print simulation filter is updated THEN it SHALL use the new noise filter internally for texture simulation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all new filters to integrate seamlessly with the existing filter system, so that I can use them consistently with other filters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I register any new filter THEN it SHALL inherit from BaseFilter and implement the FilterProtocol interface
2. WHEN I use any new filter THEN it SHALL support progress tracking, timing, and error handling like existing filters
3. WHEN I list available filters THEN the new filters SHALL appear in appropriate categories (enhancement, artistic)
4. WHEN I validate filter parameters THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for invalid inputs
5. WHEN I apply filters to large images THEN the system SHALL support chunked processing for memory efficiency

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all new filters, so that I can rely on their correctness and stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run unit tests for each filter THEN they SHALL test parameter validation, edge cases, and expected outputs
2. WHEN I run integration tests THEN they SHALL verify filter registration and interaction with the filter system
3. WHEN I test with various image formats and sizes THEN the filters SHALL handle them correctly
4. WHEN I test error conditions THEN the filters SHALL raise appropriate exceptions with clear messages
5. WHEN I run performance tests THEN the filters SHALL complete processing within reasonable time limits

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and examples for all new filters, so that I can understand how to use them effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read filter documentation THEN it SHALL include parameter descriptions, usage examples, and expected behavior
2. WHEN I look at code examples THEN they SHALL demonstrate typical usage patterns for each filter
3. WHEN I check parameter ranges THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with valid ranges and default values
4. WHEN I encounter errors THEN the error messages SHALL be descriptive and actionable
5. WHEN I use the filter registry THEN it SHALL provide metadata about each filter's capabilities and requirements
